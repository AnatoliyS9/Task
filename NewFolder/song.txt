This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow covered home
This is my December
This is me alone
And I (just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed)
And I (take back all the things I said to make you feel like that)
And I (just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed)
And I (take back all the things that I said to you)
